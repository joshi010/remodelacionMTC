                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Metacuki is a journey of one web developer student to success. Every small project made here is made just for fun and
                        to practice learned lessons. As you could already tell, my projects are not complex and fancy as someone would expect
                        them to be, but it is just a matter of time for them to be all of that. I will be uploading more and more projects over
                        time and they will be getting better and more useful. The goal of this website is to see my progress and hopefully someday help one of you in some everyday tasks.

                        <h3 class="arr" id="p1">></h3>
                    </div>


                    <p id="name-history">The name <em>METACUKI</em> was born from a friend's nickname <em>"cookie"</em> and over time our friend group started to modify it, 
                       it could be by the way we pronounced it, or the way we spelled it. That's when I started to spell it <em>"cuki"</em>. During that time NFT's where at their boom and
                       a lot of people including myself tought that they were garbage. So I used my knowledge on web pages at the time and created an NFT collection featuring <em>CUKI</em>
                       to make fun of them and showing everyone that even a random dude could make one. If you were wondering, yes it is the same <em>CUKI</em> I told you about. I thought that by including "META"
                       at the begining it will give the collection a little more emphasis to the whole NFT/Metaverse stuff. That's when <em>METACUKI</em> was born.
                    </p>

                    <div class="show-more" id="more-tog">

                        <h3 class="arr" id="p2">></h3>
                    </div>

                    <p id="more">Obviously the collection was a faliure and no one bought even one. That's fine considering that it was made just for fun, and fun was what I had the most. It was the first "serious" webpage
                        that I ever did, and I even learned how to use photoshop to make all of <em>cuki's</em> edits. Overall it was a good experience, but because I had already bought the domain name
                        <a href="https://metacuki.com" title="Go to metacuki website">metacuki.com</a> I decided to use it to upload some of my projects.

                    </p>

                    <p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not CUKI, I'm one of his friends that decided to use his image with his consent to make a "brand". I'm not using it to make money off of him in any way. You may only use his photos if it is to make a meme (It must make him laugh).</em></p>
